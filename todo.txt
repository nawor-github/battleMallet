- Make point calculation function for abilities
- Redo weapons to have tags (largely damage types) seperate from abilities
    - includes changes to read/write functions to support new layout
- Make latex layout for factions + statblocks
- Create ability creation helper that provides some example models and points
- Make ability point scores scalar (0-1) for easier weighting of different statblocks
    - e.g. range will always be larger than HP pretty much, but having to remember the vibes of each stat when poinitng is hard.
- Redo abilityDict document to support linear/nonlinear point calcs
    - maybe format constant(function)scalar. 
        - e.g. 1x1 (means 1 point * (1 x the scalar))
        - e.g. 1^1 (means 1 point to the power of (1 x the scalar))
        - e.g. 2+3 (means 2 points plus 3 x the scalar)
- Make list builder class that holds factions and numbers of models from factions
- Make faction/model editor programs
- Make read/writer support read and write only modes
